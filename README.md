# Burgers!

I love burgers is an application that allows me to keep track of the burgers I would like to eat some day.  Once I have eaten that burger I can move to the Devoured list.  If I decide I would like to try that devoured burger again, I can move back to the I want to eat list.

Burgers can be found here: [Burgers](https://rcburger.herokuapp.com/)
